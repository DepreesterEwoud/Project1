# Smart traffic lights
I have made smart traffic lights for my final project of my first year MCT

I think traffic lights is something where every cardriver struggles with. So i wanted to make some smart traffic lights to smoothen 
the traffic. For more details you can go to my instructables

# I used an Raspberry Pi to run:

Python flask webserver
MardiaDB database
Apache2 http server

# Back-end code: Python

I used python script to get everything to work.

The program i used for the python script was Visual studio Code. The code for the program can you find in app.py

Have fun!!
